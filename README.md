# Mission-to-Mars  

In this project, we are trying to web scrape methids to extract information from the [NASA Science Mars Exploration](https://mars.nasa.gov/) website using 
  - Chrome Developer tools to identify HTML components 
  - BeautifulSoup to automate the web browser and perform the scrape
  - MongoDB to store the data in a NoSQL database
  - Flask to create a web application displaying the data.
  
The goal was to develop an app to get the following information:
  - Latest news
  - Featured image
  - Facts about Mars
  - Images of the hemisphere
